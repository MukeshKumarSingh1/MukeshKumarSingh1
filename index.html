        <h3><a href="https://github.com/yourusername/project1">Open source tools and techniques based End to End Digital Forensics HandBook</a></h3>
        <p>The way Cyber crime is growing and has become and international organized crime business for fun and profit, every organization, irrespective of their size and type, needs to have some in-house Digital Forensics capabilities in place. And that seems like quite a challenging task in terms of trained resources and the cost involved. Despite one managing to arrange the money and resources, they didn’t have basic guidelines and structure as reference to setup the environment. 

There is a clear need for an Open Source Tools and Techniques Based Digital Forensics documented guidelines that could easily be integrated with existing DFIR environment and allows easy integration irrespective of their size and type of the organization.

This project is about developing a standard set of documented guidelines for conducting Digital Forensics, whether it be for individual purposes or for any corporate internal investigation and most importantly, it is free for all.

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/yourusername/project1">KAPE and Autopsy based enterprise wide automated and real-time Incident Response and Full disk forensics data collection, processing and presentation</a></h3>
        <p>	

The idea is to create an open source and freely available tools and techniques based, enterprise-wide automated incident Response and Digital Forensics project to automate the real time data collection, procession and presenting results in a faster and clear way, that could easily be integrated with existing enterprise systems viz: 

1> Sinkhole: DNS/IP based malware identification in real-time

2> SIEM: Enterprise log management alerting and and analysis system

3> Threat Intel tool: MISP

4> Ticketing Systems like: ServiceNow and other

5> Fireeye (EMPS/WMPS): Email and web based malware system

6> etc.

And use open source and Autopsy (solr-based) for full disk forensics in an automated way. I completed this project in mid 2020, reworking on this project to refine it further, and make it available to organizations, who are looking for: 

1> a real time evidence collection, processing and fast analysis in a automated way,

2> could easily be integrated with existing DFIR setup and enhance the real time analysis of incidents.

3> who can’t afford the costly enterprise-grade Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) products

4> Full disk forensics using open source and freely available tools

They could simply use this open-source and freely available tools-based project, project to automate the entire DFIR response within the organization. 

Note: The best part of this project is that it could allow covert data collection from any system under your control irrespective of its geographic location.

The idea of this framework development is to help end users understand, how adversaries hack humans and control them for years using well known tactics viz: </p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/yourusername/project1">Project 1</a></h3>
        <p>The idea of this project is to create a set of basic guidelines with some basic customizable scripts to create an automated endpoint and develop some automated threat detection and response for end users using open sources and freely available resources. </p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/yourusername/project1">	

The project is based on a real life incident (long) while a big group of corrupt and criminals gang, started using their power, connection and resources (including the government resources) to isolate, manipulate, control and backstab an innocent to conduct a hate crime in a foreign land.

The only thing that saved him (the innocent) is the real time OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) he keeps gathering and changing his tactics to deal with it.

This project simply describes the set of tools and techniques utilized to gather real time intelligence to deal with an adversary. This may further be enhanced depending on time availability. </a></h3>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/yourusername/project1">Guidelines for Auditing and Logging</a></h3>
        <p>	

It was around 2005, and while SIEM and Log Management systems were evolving, dealing with cyber security incidents in an enterprise environment was a tough job. And especially if we talk about orthodox government departments.

While dealing with various Cyber Security incidents and providing support to various sizes and types of organizations, I came across an idea to have a standard document for logging and auditing systems and applications and this project came into picture. I did my best and handed over the paper before leaving the organization in March 2007, and later on, refined it further by my brilliant ex-colleagues and published it as “Guidelines for Auditing and Logging” in December 2008.

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/yourusername/project1">Root-kits Analysis and Detection</a></h3>
        <p>	

“The name, root kit, suggests a component that allows obtaining root access in a computer system, its only purpose is to help an attacker into keeping a previously obtained root access”

This was a joint study of mine and my senior colleague, well-wisher and mentor Jayanta Perial (from CDAC Kolkata, who is no longer in the world), while working together at Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), and was intended to be a research paper or some kind of security guidelines, but he got transferred back to his parent organization CDAC Kolkata, and I became the lead and was left alone to work on it, and it never got completed.

However, on March 29, 2005, we presented and demonstrated our work and ideas at a workshop titled “Malicious Code Trends and Countermeasures.”

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/yourusername/project1">RedHat Enterprise Linux 3.0 Minimization and Hardening Guidelines</a></h3>
        <p>	
	

Every day new vulnerabilities and zero-day flaws are discovered, published, and exploited by cyber security professionals across the IT domains. In this ever-changing, vulnerable world of IT, operating system customization and hardening play a key role in server security and minimization of vulnerabilities in the system.

While dealing with various cyber security incidents and providing support for various organizations, I realize the main cause of the issue is default vendor system installation and no further customization.

This was my first research project and I worked for almost 6 months to complete this project and published it in May 2005.
